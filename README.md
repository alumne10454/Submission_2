# Submission_2
This assignment consists of creating our first UI design, and apply usability, and accessibility to it. My first UI is inspired by my original character called Lupi. She is a colorful clown, so the game is inspired by coloring books and programs like Paint. This UI consists of the logo, 4 buttons, a footer and the background image.
